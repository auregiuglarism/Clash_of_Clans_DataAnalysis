# Clash_of_Clans_Data_Analysis
A data analysis of the most optimal defence structures and offence troops in the popular game: Clash of Clans.

Our repository is organized under two folders: one dedicated to the analysis of troops and heroes (Townhall LV 9 Max) and the other dedicated to the analysis of the game's defences.

## Data Analysis Video

Taking the example of Jerry, a fictional player of the game at townhall level 9 who recently acquired data analysis skills, we answer the following research questions and present our analysis in the following video: 

## A bit of vocabulary

The following vocabulary is necessary to understand the analysis: <br>
Townhall : The level of your townhall describes the level of your village and reflects how far you are in the game, here Jerry is level 9. The maximum level a player can reach right now is 14 (as of 22/03/2024). <br>
HP : Hitpoints or Health points describes the health of your heroes, troops and defences in your village. <br>
DPS : Damage Per Second reflects how much damage is done in a second by a troop, hero or defence. <br>

## Research Questions

**RQ1**: Jerry wants to know which troop is the best in the game statwise (DPS, HP, Speed) compared to the housing spaces to focus his resources on this troop (the healer will be an outlier). <br>
<br>
**RQ2**: Jerry wants to know which defence structure is the best overall (DPS, HP), taking into account aerial and ground damage dealt. <br>
<br>
**RQ3**: Finally Jerry wants to know which hero is most powerful again to focus on improving this hero first before others (Townhall 9 has the Archer Queen and the Barbarian King)
